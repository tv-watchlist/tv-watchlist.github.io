With one fateful and principled decision in the ER, Hank loses it all. Months later, single and blackballed from the medical community, Hank goes for a weekend in the Hamptons with his best friend. Crashing a party at a mega-mansion on the beach, Hank jumps into action when a guest requires medical attention that only he is able to diagnose. The next morning, Hank is summoned to another mansion. And then another. Hank\'s career is revived, but in a way he\'s not exactly happy about, as he becomes the on-call doctor for the rich, famous and infamous. Anyone who\'s anyone in the Hamptons has a lawyer on retainer.
